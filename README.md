# Fault Prediction Using Neural Networks

This project focuses on predicting whether a given piece of code is "good" or "bad" based on a dataset using neural networks. Fault prediction is essential in software engineering to identify problematic code that may lead to errors or issues in software applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various code snippets, along with labels indicating whether each snippet is considered "good" or "bad." This dataset serves as the foundation for training and testing the neural network.

You can find the dataset [here](https://link-to-your-dataset).

## Neural Network

Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure of the human brain. In this project, a neural network is used to learn patterns and relationships in the dataset, allowing it to classify code as either "good" or "bad."

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fault-prediction-neural-network.git
   cd fault-prediction-neural-network
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Neural Network**:

   Run the neural network on the code dataset. You can find the code in `neural_network.py`.

4. **View Results**:

   The results, including the accuracy of the model and other relevant metrics, will be displayed.

## Results

The project provides insights into fault prediction in code, including model accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

## Usage

You can use this project as a reference for fault prediction using neural networks. The code is well-documented and structured for easy understanding and adaptation for similar tasks.
